            <p>You seem like you might like to work for larger established businesses building internal software. C# has been around for a long time, so it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market.  Since you seem to be comfortable with the idea of working in a little cubicle for a huge corporate company, it seems C# would be a great fit for you!/p>

            <p> Yay! You might be perfect for the Java Track. Java's popularity and long standing performance for years has created a high-demand for this language in the modern job market. Like C#, Java is in demand by the huge corporate beasts that chew people up and spit them out like a small child who rejects the food their parents are feeding them. It has a broader scope than C# though: programmers use Java for building Android user interfaces, which kicks major ass and is probably a really awesome way to make a living. Cheers!</p>
